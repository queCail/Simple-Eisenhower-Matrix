This is just a little project made to pratice some of the knowledge acquired in the last few months. Don't expect it to do much for now, but it will get better over time as I learn new tools.

Many of the code's features were made to accomodate future functionalities.

Also, the code present's some issues, but those will also be resolved in the near future.

Feel free to run and test it for now!
